TO DO:
- update the plugin writing documentation--seriously out of date.
- network scanning using nmap input, controlling nmap directly, or even the slow perl way
- send a single request via the command line (useful for specific vul testing w/o a full scan, especially SSL)
- continue to enahnce the proxy junk so a multi-user system can let each user have their own proxy id/password
