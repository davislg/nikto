       - Removed unecessary counters
       - Replaced some slow foreach counters
       - Moved proxy_check earlier, before port_scan, so it will be set first

       - Bugfix: a regex/logic/if error in test_target, thanks Pavel Kankovsky for the bug report. 401/302 messages will now report regardless of test/pass fail.
       - Bugfix: -dbcheck now identifies duplicates without relying on message text, thanks Jericho / Attrition.org for pointing this out
       
	nikto.pl	1.12

09.24.2003  Nikto 1.31 release
	nikto_core.plugin	1.16
       - Fixed a bug in resolve() that may prevent name lookups when host files used
       - Fixed a bug in resolve() where scan would exit if 1 name resolution from host file failed
       - Changed set_targets so that if the -h value exists as a file it reads that instead of resolving it as a name. This eliminates need for .csv or .txt file name endings.
       - Added auto or semi-auto update of version strings to CIRT.net. This is done through a simple GET request. Controlled via config.txt's UPDATES variable.
         *ABSOLUTELY NO* server info is sent... only versions from HTTP headers, i.e. "Apache/4.0". Thanks to Jericho for feedback/ideas.

        - killed as many global vars as I could stand in favor of a few global hashes (CLI input, etc.)
