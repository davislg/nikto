#VERSION,1.079
#LASTMOD,07.16.2003

# versions file for nikto_outdated.pl
# part of the Nikto scanner package
# format is "match string","Version","Message"

# If you can think of a way to automate the retrieval for ANY of this data...please help!

# Check Rules
# 1. match strings MUST end with their separator character, i.e. "/" for this to work right!
# 2. spaces are NOT allowed in the match or as separators. apache modules will be split out ok. 'version' will be
#    determined as follows if there is not a '/' present in the id string
#    (example is based on server seperator string "Specialx JETSTREAM 1.0")
#    a. Remove a-Z, 0-9 or '.'  (sep String is now "  ")
#    b. Condense multi spaces to 1 (sep String is now " ")
#    c. Split Server string with sep string, last is version num ("1.0")
#    d. Add sepr (if space, use '/') before version num ("/1.0")
#    e. rejoin string with (no spaces on join) "SpecialxJETSTREAM/1.0"
