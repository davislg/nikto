- Files -
doc.xml       -  Full Nikto 2 documentation as found on cirt.net
doc_short.xml -  Trimmed documentation as included in the Nikto source distribution
manpage.xml   -  Man page

- Editing -
These file were written in DocBook format with the XML Mind editor, though any 
editor that can properly handle DocBook should work fine. If changes are made in 
one file, it is possible they should be made in both--please check!

- Updates - 
The doc_short.xml should be exported in HTML one page with table of contents, and then
committed to the Nikto 2 trunk space. The updated xml should be committed as well.

Updates to the full documention should be committed in xml format, and a notification 
sent to sullo@cirt.net for update to the web site.
